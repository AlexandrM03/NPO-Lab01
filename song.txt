Betrayed - Lil Xan

Hey
(You are now listening to a Bobby Johnson beat)
What? yeah
Ayy-ayy
Pop the trunk, I open up
I sold my soul a good price, outta sight
And my hoe got talent, right?
Whole squad ran through that shit, yikes
I'm a businessman, I did my business, damn
And I'ma bend it down, then I'ma lick her up and then dick her down
She gon' turn around then I'ma kick her out, she gon' talk that shit but still
How you make it up?
How you fake a love?
Holy son, I was the chosen one, I'm sippin' out the grail
She don't kiss and tell
She keep my wishes well, I don't need her, well
How my enemy a friend of me?
Why y'all feed off of my energy?
Like I ain't dead yet, higher entity
Foreign bitch that think she into me
Whip the foreign very viciously
Why these dudes wanna take pics with me?
She said she gay, but still into me
She said she gay, still into me
Said she hate that I'm in the streets
And I said I hate that I'm in the streets
I wanna blow up and make history
Said she hate my Insta feed

Your bitch just like a Crayola, what? Ayy
You can draw her on the table, flip her like some yola
Heart-shaped kisses, I really miss my mistress
And 666, evil bitches want my mentions
Heart-shaped kisses, really miss my mistress
And it's 666, evil bitches want my mentions
